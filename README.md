# Starred GitHub Repositories

> A small webapp that lists the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days from [GitHub Public API](https://api.github.com/) into React state. The JSON data fetched directly from the API is rendered to the users. As teh user keeps scrolling, new results are automatically fetched and rendered to the user.
